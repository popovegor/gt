NUnit Extensions
================

Place your NUnit extension assemblies in a directory
called 'addins' next to this file. If the extension
references 'nunit.core' make sure that it's compiled
against the same version of 'nunit.core' that's in
the parent directory.

For an example extension see the NUnit source distribution:
src\samples\Extensibility\Core\CoreExtensibility.sln
